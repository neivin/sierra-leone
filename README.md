A tool to help me shop for lab grown diamonds online and analyze the best value, cut and price combinations.

This tool will help you analyze deals for diamonds that are:
1. Grown in a lab (vs. natural and mined from the earth)
2. Round in shape

It mostly uses the data from diamondscreener.com, especially the data for estimating the quality of the cut of the
stone.
